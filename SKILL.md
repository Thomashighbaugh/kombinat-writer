# Kombinat Writer — Professional Book Writing Methodology

This skill contains the complete Kombinat Writer methodology for producing long-form written work with AI assistance. It covers three workflow tracks (fiction, non-fiction, mixed), the full command architecture, project file conventions, and how companion sub-skills activate per-phase.

## Core Principles

1. **Phase separation** — Each phase of writing has a distinct goal, output, and quality gate. Never conflate drafting with editing, or research with revision.
2. **Progressive elaboration** — Start lean and add detail only when needed. No document exceeds ~500 lines without splitting.
3. **Externalised knowledge** — Character profiles, research notes, citations, and tracking data live in dedicated files, not in the AI's context window.
4. **Structured iteration** — Critique and revision are formal phases with defined inputs and outputs, not informal back-and-forth.
5. **Track-appropriate rigour** — Fiction and non-fiction share the same architectural principles but differ in their quality gates (consistency vs. factual accuracy).

## The Three Tracks

| Track | When to Use | Core Phases |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Fiction** | Novels, short stories, serials, narrative non-fiction with creative elements | Constitute → Specify → Clarify → Research → Outline → Task → Draft → Critique → Revise → Edit → Review → Publish |
| **Non-fiction** | Academic works, journalism, biography, technical books, essays, reports | Constitute → Research → Annotate → Outline → Draft (with citations) → Critique → Fact-check → Revise → Review → Publish |
| **Mixed** | Creative non-fiction, memoir with research, narrative journalism | Constitute → Specify + Research → Clarify → Outline → Draft with citation markers → Critique → Revise → Edit → Fact-check → Review → Publish |

## Command Architecture

Kombinat Writer exposes a single hub command `/kombinat` with a TUI menu system for each workflow phase. When invoked without a subcommand, `/kombinat` presents a menu of available phases. The "Guided" option runs automatic state detection and presents a contextualised roadmap.

### Phase Commands

| Subcommand | Alias | Phase | Track | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| `constitute` | `const` | 1 | All | Define creative or intellectual principles, quality baseline, and non-negotiables |
| `specify` | `spec` | 2 | Fiction, Mixed | Build a lean story specification and knowledge map |
| `clarify` | `clar` | 3 | Fiction, Mixed | Resolve ambiguities in the specification |
| `research` | `rsrc` | 2/4 | All | Active research: web search, source ingestion, annotation, literature review |
| `outline` | `plan` | 4/5 | All | Chapter structure, pacing, argument arc, foreshadowing, or thesis progression |
| `task-manager` | `tasks` | 5/6 | All | Break outline into tracked, dependency-ordered tasks |
| `draft` | `write` | 6/7 | All | Write chapters or sections with pre-draft checklist |
| `critique` | `alpha` | 7/8 | All | Structured external-feedback simulation: alpha, beta, peer, sensitivity |
| `revise` | `revision` | 8/9 | All | Plan revisions, categorise feedback, track changes |
| `edit` | `editor` | 9/10 | All | Line-level editing with suggestion tracking and approved-edit application |
| `review` | `qa` | 10/11 | All | Broad project QA: continuity, consistency, factual accuracy, readiness |
| `cite` | `citation` | 3 | Non-fiction | Citation ingestion, formatting, bibliography generation, validation |
| `publish` | `pub` | 11/12 | All | Format export, submission preparation, metadata packaging |
| `track` | — | Utility | All | Unified tracking: characters, plots, timelines, sources, themes |
| `timeline` | — | Utility | All | Chronological consistency verification |
| `meta` | — | Utility | All | Bibliographic metadata management |
| `drafter` | — | Utility | All | Loose draft jumpstart from raw ideas |

### Shorthand Aliases

The `/kombinat` command uses the hubMenu tool for routing. Subcommands are selected via the TUI menu; direct dispatch works by appending the subcommand label (e.g. `/kombinat draft`).

### Split Mode

When any document exceeds ~500 lines, split into a folder with `_main.md` as the index:

- `specification.md` → `specification/_main.md` + shards (`core.md`, `world.md`, `cast.md`, `plot.md`)
- `outline.md` → `outline/_main.md` + shards per part or arc
- `tasks.md` → `tasks/_main.md` + shards per phase

## Plugin Maintenance: Refresh & Index

The kombinat-writer plugin evolves. To sync an installed project with the latest plugin source without overwriting your project work, use:

```bash
npx kombinat-refresh        # idempotent: syncs plugin assets, rebuilds index, preserves local edits
npx kombinat-index          # rebuild only the lore semantic index
```

`kombinat-refresh` writes a manifest at `.opencode/.kombinat-install-manifest.json` that records every file it installed (with per-file SHA256) so subsequent refreshes are diff-based — your HTML-comment overrides in phase specs are preserved across refreshes. Run `--force` to overwrite them (destructive).

The semantic lore index lives at `.opencode/cache/lore-index/index.json` and is consulted on every phase invocation. The index is built incrementally — re-running on an up-to-date index is a no-op. Index coverage includes: series lorebook, series outline, per-book knowledge, constitution, specification, book outline (whole + per-chapter), and XML drafts (chunked by `<metadata>`, `<awareness-map>`, and per-`<scene>`). See the README for full details.

Phase specs that need continuity (`draft`, `critique`, `revise`) use `--pin-chapter N --pin-side previous|both` to include the entire adjacent chapter(s) verbatim in the context, regardless of semantic score.

## Phase Detail Summary

### Phase 1: Constitute (all tracks)
Establish the governing principles for the entire work. Output: `constitution.md`

| Section | Fiction | Non-fiction |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Core Values | Theme, message, emotional intent | Thesis, argument, purpose |
| Quality Baseline | Prose standards, pacing preference | Rigour standards, evidence requirements |

| Content Principles | Character, plot, worldbuilding norms | Chapter structure, argument flow, citation density |
| Reader Contract | Genre expectations, content warnings | Audience level, assumed knowledge |
| Revision Procedures | How revision decisions are made | How factual corrections are handled |

### Phase 2-3: Specify & Clarify (fiction/mixed)
Create the story's blueprint and resolve ambiguities. Output: `specification.md` + `knowledge/`

### Phase 2: Research (non-fiction/mixed)
Active research phase: gather sources, evaluate credibility, extract annotations, build bibliography. Output: `research/` directory

### Phase 4: Outline (all tracks)
Convert specification or research into a structured chapter-by-chapter or section-by-section plan. Output: `outline.md` or `outline/`

### Phase 5: Task Manager (all tracks)
Break the outline into tracked, dependency-ordered tasks. Output: `tasks.md` or `tasks/`

### Phase 6: Draft (all tracks)
Write chapters one at a time with the pre-draft checklist ensuring full context is loaded. Output: `content/chapter_NNNNN.md`

### Phase 7: Critique (all tracks)
Simulate structured external feedback. Modes: alpha reader (structural), beta reader (experience), peer review (field-appropriate), sensitivity reader. Output: `critique/round-N/`

### Phase 8: Revise (all tracks)
Categorise critique feedback, plan revisions, apply changes with tracking. Output: `revisions/revision-log.md`

### Phase 9: Edit (all tracks)
Line-level pass: suggest changes, track approvals, apply confirmed edits. Output: updated chapters

### Phase 10: Review (all tracks)
Broad project QA: continuity, tracking accuracy, factual verification (non-fiction), final readiness assessment. Output: review report

### Phase 11: Publish (all tracks)
Format export, metadata packaging, submission preparation. Output: `output/`

## Conventions

- **Phase-gate discipline**: Complete each phase's output before starting the next. The `/kombinat guided` subcommand enforces this.
- **One chapter per file**: `content/chapter_NNNNN.md` with zero-padded numbering.
- **Context reload**: The pre-draft checklist ensures constitution, specification, outline, knowledge, tracking, and previous chapter are loaded before every new chapter.
- **Split at 500 lines**: Any file approaching 500 lines should be split into a directory with `_main.md` as index.
- **Serious tone**: All command output uses professional register. No emoji in generated content.
